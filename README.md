# EEG-Signal-Classification
 14 Channel EEG Time-Series Classification whether eyes of a human are shut or open.
 
## Data
We have 14 channels of EEG time-series signals of the brain activity. In the following we have 4 EEG channels plotted and the label as signal a signal is plotted, whether the human has their eyes shut (0) or open (1):
