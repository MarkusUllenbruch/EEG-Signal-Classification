# EEG-Signal-Classification
 8 Channel EEG Time-Series Classification whether eyes of a human are shut or open.
 
## Data
We have 14 channels of EEG time-series signals of the brain activity. In the following we have 4 channels plotted and the last plot is the label as signal, whether the human has their eyes shut (0) or open (1):

Based on the brain activity signals, we want to predict if the humand has their eyes shut or open at the moment.
